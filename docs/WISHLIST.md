add:

remove:

change:
Move out all common functions to the rvm file as opposed to the runtime files. 
This will allow us to update runtime template and runtimes without affecting the common functions.


To prune secondary functions:
1) Limit to only add, remove, use, set, update and maybe prune 
2) For node, install latest should be newest / latest node, latest lts should be newest lts
